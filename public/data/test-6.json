If the likelihood, or probability, that a person will vote is linked to that person&rsquo;s level of political knowledge and interest, that would suggest that negatively affecting a person&rsquo;s level of political knowledge and interest would also negatively affect how likely that person is to vote.

Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old&mdash;much older than the Clovis people&rsquo;s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces&mdash;that they are human-made tools&mdash;that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group&rsquo;s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn&rsquo;t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group&rsquo;s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent&rsquo;s first inhabitants. Therefore, there&rsquo;s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.</p>"

However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species&rsquo; level of the compound TMAO.

Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher.

According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself.</p>"

The text explains that, according to some climate models, precipitation in the western United States will become concentrated into fewer, more intense rain and snow events. According to the text, Persad and her colleagues concluded that more irrigation will consequently be needed but that the change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to, or greatly affected by, the baseline concentration of precipitation in an area. This conclusion is supported by data from the researchers&rsquo; simulations of changes in annual irrigation output in two different scenarios&mdash;one in which an area&rsquo;s annual precipitation is already somewhat concentrated and one in which its annual precipitation is evenly distributed. The table shows that if baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed, water use for irrigation will increase much more&mdash;9.0% for surface water and 7.9% for groundwater.

The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth under current climate conditions without nitrogen fertilization to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes.

studied a forest site in which some sugar maple trees receive periodic fertilization with nitrogen to mimic the broader trend of increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition in soil. Ibáñez and colleagues modeled the radial growth of the trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate scenarios (the current climate, moderate change, and extreme change). Although they found that climate change would negatively affect growth, they concluded that anthropogenic nitrogen deposition could more than offset that effect provided that change is moderate rather than extreme.</p>"

It's given that the two box plots show the distribution of number of books read over the summer by the students in two different English classes. In a box plot, the first vertical line represents the minimum value of the data set and the last vertical line represents the maximum value of the data set. The range of a data set is the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value. In class A, the maximum number of books read is <math alttext=\"5\"><mn>5</mn>\n</math> and the minimum number of books read is <math alttext=\"0\"><mn>0</mn>\n</math>. The difference between those values is <math alttext=\"5 minus 0\"><mn>5</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>0</mn></math>, or <math alttext=\"5\"><mn>5</mn>\n</math>. Therefore, the range of the number of books read in class A is <math alttext=\"5\"><mn>5</mn>\n</math>. In class B, the maximum number of books read is <math alttext=\"10\"><mn>10</mn>\n</math> and the minimum number of books read is <math alttext=\"1\"><mn>1</mn>\n</math>. The difference between those values is <math alttext=\"10 minus 1\"><mn>10</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></math>, or <math alttext=\"9\"><mn>9</mn>\n</math>. Therefore, the range of the number of books read in class B is <math alttext=\"9\"><mn>9</mn>\n</math>. To find the positive difference between the ranges of the number of books read for the two classes, the smaller range must be subtracted from the larger range. Therefore, the positive difference between the ranges of number of books read over the summer for the two classes is <math alttext=\"9 minus 5\"><mn>9</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>5</mn></math>, or <math alttext=\"4\"><mn>4</mn>\n</math>.</p>"

It's given that each vertex of the rectangle lies on the circumference of the circle. Therefore, the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle, where the shortest side and the longest side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Let <math alttext=\"s\"><mi>s</mi>\n</math> represent the length, in units, of the shortest side of the rectangle. Since it's given that the diagonal is twice the length of the shortest side, <math alttext=\"2 s\"><mrow>\n\t<mn>2</mn>\n\t<mi>s</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math> represents the length, in units, of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length <math alttext=\"c\"><mi>c</mi>\n</math> and legs with lengths <math alttext=\"a\"><mi>a</mi>\n</math> and <math alttext=\"b\"><mi>b</mi>\n</math>, then <math alttext=\"a squared plus b squared equals c squared\"><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>.

Two segments that are tangent to a circle and have a common exterior endpoint have equal length. Therefore, segment <math alttext=\"upper M upper H\"><mi>M</mi><mi>H</mi></math> and segment <math alttext=\"upper N upper H\"><mi>N</mi><mi>H</mi></math> have equal length. Let <math alttext=\"x\"><mi>x</mi>\n</math> represent the length of segment <math alttext=\"upper M upper H\"><mi>M</mi><mi>H</mi></math>. Then <math alttext=\"x\"><mi>x</mi>\n</math> also represents the length of segment <math alttext=\"upper N upper H\"><mi>N</mi><mi>H</mi></math>. It's given that the perimeter of quadrilateral&nbsp;<math alttext=\"upper G upper M upper H upper N\"><mi>G</mi><mi>M</mi><mi>H</mi><mi>N</mi></math> is <math alttext=\"3,856\"><mn>3,856</mn>\n</math> millimeters.

A line segment that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Therefore, segment&nbsp;<math alttext=\"upper G upper M\"><mi>G</mi><mi>M</mi></math> is perpendicular to segment&nbsp;<math alttext=\"upper M upper H\"><mi>M</mi><mi>H</mi></math>. Since perpendicular segments form right angles, angle&nbsp;<math alttext=\"upper G upper M upper H\"><mi>G</mi><mi>M</mi><mi>H</mi></math> is a right angle.

By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length <math alttext=\"c\"><mi>c</mi>\n</math> and legs with lengths <math alttext=\"a\"><mi>a</mi>\n</math> and <math alttext=\"b\"><mi>b</mi>\n</math>, then <math alttext=\"a squared plus b squared equals c squared\"><mrow>\n\t<mrow>\n\t\t<msup>\n\t\t\t<mi>a</mi>\n\t\t\t<mn>2</mn>\n\t\t</msup>\n\t\t<mo>+</mo>\n\t\t<msup>\n\t\t\t<mi>b</mi>\n\t\t\t<mn>2</mn>\n\t\t</msup>\n\t</mrow>\n\t<mo>=</mo>\n\t<msup>\n\t\t<mi>c</mi>\n\t\t<mn>2</mn>\n\t</msup>\n</mrow>\n</math>.
