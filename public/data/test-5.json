The text then describes an experiment conducted by an anthropologist to test this hypothesis. According to the text, the results of the experiment led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren&rsquo;t the primary cause of the extinction. The anthropologist&rsquo;s results cast doubt on the long-held hypothesis presented at the beginning of the text and suggest that woolly mammoths may have become extinct in North America due to some other cause.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that researchers have been involved in an ongoing debate. On the contrary, the text suggests that most researchers agree on the cause of the woolly mammoth&rsquo;s extinction in North America. Choice B is incorrect because the text never mentions any advantages or disadvantages of the method used in the experiment, focusing instead on the results achieved using that method. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only one hypothesis, that mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points. Rather than present a competing hypothesis, the text explains how one anthropologist designed an experiment to test this long-held hypothesis.</p>"

The text indicates that researchers were exposing two groups of male bold jumping spiders (field-collected and laboratory-reared) to different stimuli and observing their subsequent behaviors. The text goes on to detail the observations made by the research team: field-collected spiders displayed aggressive behaviors when fed a high-protein diet and preferred flowers manipulated to display ultraviolet fluorescence, while laboratory-reared spiders displayed aggressive behaviors when fed a high-lipid diet and preferred nonfluorescent flowers that were dyed red. It can be inferred from the text that the rearing conditions (field versus laboratory) of the spiders was the independent variable for the experiment. Thus, it follows that the conditions in which the spiders were reared likely affect their response to the different experimental stimuli presented.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that both groups of male bold jumping spiders (field-collected and lab-reared) displayed aggressive behaviors depending on the experimental diet they were exposed to. Additionally, the researchers observed the response of the spiders to different experimental stimuli, not the effect of rearing location on male spider aggression. Choice C is incorrect. The experiment detailed in the text compared two groups of bold jumping spiders reared in different settings&mdash;a lab setting, in which spiders were fed a high-lipid diet, and a field setting, in which spiders were fed a high-protein diet. The text does not speculate about whether the laboratory setting was more suitable to studying some aspects of the spiders&rsquo; behavior than to studying other aspects of it. Choice D is incorrect. Although the experiment discussed in the text involved both lab-reared and field-collected specimens of the bold jumping spider, the text never suggests that lab-reared specimens were somehow superior to field-collected specimens or necessarily recommends the use of lab-reared specimens in experiments.</p>"

The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun&rsquo;s corona precedes the appearance of the flare.

In this context \"prudently\" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science fiction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"cordially\" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a significant factor for women writing science fiction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s. The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. It&rsquo;s unclear how \"less deliberately signaled\" politics and an increasing sense of politeness toward feminism would constitute a meaningful contrast. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"inadvertently\" would mean unintentionally, and nothing in the text suggests that Yaszek thought the feminist elements of the woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s arose without deliberate effort.</p>"

The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months&rsquo; work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer&rsquo;s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel&rsquo;s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel&rsquo;s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text&mdash;that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.</p>"

The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of <em>T. navigans</em>, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that <em>T. navigans</em> had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make <em>T. navigans</em> different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, <em>T. navigans</em> likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that <em>T. navigans</em> would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight.

Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that <em>T. navigans </em>had a large-crested head.

According to the text, the researchers&rsquo; study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave, and a group who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2&ndash;4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2&ndash;4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect.

But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave with those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers&rsquo; conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave.

benefits of taking leave from work, psychologist Jan Packer and colleagues conducted a six-month study of Australian university staff members who took no leave from work during the study, took 2–4 days of leave, or took 1–5 weeks of leave. Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration. After analyzing the results, the researchers concluded that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.</p>"

Text 1 begins by asserting that efforts to automate classification of paintings into different styles have been largely unsuccessful and that technological limits are likely to prevent significant success. Text 2 concedes that automated artistic style classifiers have found it difficult to distinguish between Baroque paintings and Renaissance paintings, but the text goes on to describe the work of Ravneet Singh Arora and Ahmed Elgammal, who have achieved a greater accuracy in classification by running one model on top of another. Text 2 concludes by describing Arora and Elgammal&rsquo;s approach as one that demonstrates that innovation is still possible in the field. Thus, the author of Text 2 would not agree with the underlined claim in Text 1 that the technological limits of automated painting classification models have been reached: instead, the author of Text 2 would emphasize that there are still advances being made in automated artistic style classification.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that its author would criticize previous research into automated artistic style classification systems for focusing on a narrow group of styles. Additionally, such a criticism, if it were present in Text 2, would not address the claim in the underlined sentence of Text 1, since Text 1&rsquo;s claim is concerned with the lack of success of automated classifiers and their technological limits, not with the focus of previous research into automated artistic style classification systems. Choice C is incorrect. While Text 1 does argue that differences between artistic styles are subjective, implying that two reasonable people might disagree about whether a painting is an example of one style or another, neither Text 1 nor Text 2 addresses whether most people can accurately identify the styles of paintings they are shown. Rather, both texts are concerned mainly with the potential accuracy of automated artistic style classifiers. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 provides no support for the assertion that its author would suggest that people may develop more uniform and accepted ideas regarding artistic classifications. Additionally, such a suggestion, if it were present in Text 2, would not address the claim in the underlined sentence of Text 1, since Text 1&rsquo;s claim is concerned with the lack of success of automated classifiers and their technological limits, not with the uniformity or acceptability of people&rsquo;s ideas about artistic styles and their boundaries.</p>"

The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis regarding this question&mdash;which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer&mdash;and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team&rsquo;s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team&rsquo;s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn&rsquo;t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team&rsquo;s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn&rsquo;t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn&rsquo;t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo&rsquo;s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct.

Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s era were aware of his works, not that they were \"antagonistic toward,\" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by.

Therefore, <math alttext=\"upper D upper E equals 40\"><mrow>\n\t<mrow>\n\t\t<mi>D</mi>\n\t\t<mi>E</mi>\n\t</mrow>\n\t<mo>=</mo>\n\t<mn>40</mn>\n</mrow>\n</math>. Since <math alttext=\"upper D upper E\"><mrow>\n\t<mi>D</mi>\n\t<mi>E</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math> and <math alttext=\"upper A upper E\"><mrow>\n\t<mi>A</mi>\n\t<mi>E</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math> represent the lengths of the legs of triangle <math alttext=\"upper A upper D upper E\"><mrow>\n\t<mi>A</mi>\n\t<mi>D</mi>\n\t<mi>E</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math>, it follows that <math alttext=\"upper D upper E\"><mrow>\n\t<mi>D</mi>\n\t<mi>E</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math> and <math alttext=\"upper A upper E\"><mrow>\n\t<mi>A</mi>\n\t<mi>E</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math> can be used to calculate the area, in square units, of the triangle as <math alttext=\"one half left parenthesis 40 right parenthesis left parenthesis 24 right parenthesis\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mfenced><mn>40</mn></mfenced><mfenced><mn>24</mn></mfenced></math>, or <math alttext=\"480\"><mn>480</mn>\n</math>.&nbsp;Therefore, the area, in square units, of triangle <math alttext=\"upper A upper D upper E\"><mrow>\n\t<mi>A</mi>\n\t<mi>D</mi>\n\t<mi>E</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math> is <math alttext=\"480\"><mn>480</mn>\n</math>.</p>"

Since the left-hand side of each equation is equal to <math alttext=\"7 r\"><mrow>\n\t<mn>7</mn>\n\t<mi>r</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math>, setting the right-hand side of the equations equal to each other yields <math alttext=\"p w minus 6 equals 10 w plus 11\"><mi>p</mi><mi>w</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn><mi>w</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>11</mn></math>. A linear equation in one variable, <math alttext=\"w\"><mi>w</mi>\n</math>, has no solution if and only if the equation is false; that is, when there's no value of <math alttext=\"w\"><mi>w</mi>\n</math> that produces a true statement.
