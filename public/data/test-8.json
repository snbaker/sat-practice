However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven&rsquo;t consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren&rsquo;t necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager&rsquo;s appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird&rsquo;s overall fitness.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Shultz&rsquo;s finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids. Choice B is incorrect because Shultz&rsquo;s finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers&rsquo; feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness. Whether the signal of fitness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it&rsquo;s true, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s actually true. Since there&rsquo;s no information in the text about how potential mates respond to the dishonest signals of some tanagers, there&rsquo;s no support for the idea that the dishonest signals are less effective than the honest signals.

According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them&mdash;that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000&ndash;57,000 newtons and 35,000&ndash;63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000&ndash;235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000&ndash;34,000 newtons).

The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn&rsquo;t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson&rsquo;s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can&rsquo;t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don&rsquo;t support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.</p>"

The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there&rsquo;s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don&rsquo;t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn&rsquo;t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn&rsquo;t weaken Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn&rsquo;t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn&rsquo;t undermine Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn&rsquo;t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.</p>"

To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant&rsquo;s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows&rsquo; health overall.</p>"

If Mexican American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes&rsquo;s argument by suggesting that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than  traditions from Spain.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs influenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes&rsquo;s view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore.

Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican American folklore across regions would not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes&rsquo;s argument that the folklore reflects various cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States.

The text states that some economists have asserted that firms are increasingly using automation in part because doing so improves productivity. The text goes on to point out, however, that Acemoglu et al. have shown that automation does not necessarily lead to remarkable productivity gains. In addition, Acemoglu et al. have shown that the US tax code makes it more advantageous for firms to invest money in automation technology than to spend the same amount of money on labor&mdash;that is, on workers&mdash;to perform the same tasks. A firm that spends a certain amount of money on labor could instead spend that money on automation technology and reduce the amount of taxes it must pay, thereby benefiting the firm even if the firm saw no increase in productivity. These findings therefore suggest that the increasing adoption of automation technology by US firms may be more attributable to the US government indirectly incentivizing&mdash;through the tax code&mdash;the adoption of that technology than to automation being directly beneficial for firms&rsquo; outputs.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does suggest that some economists may have overestimated the productivity gains associated with automation technology, nothing in the text supports the idea that those economists may have also overestimated the tax benefits of automation technology. Instead, the text presents the work of Acemoglu et al. as showing that the tax benefits of automation technology may be an important factor in explaining why firms have been increasingly adopting that technology. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the current structure of the US tax code, which treats expenditures on automation technology differently than expenditures on labor, encourages firms to adopt that technology. If the tax code changed to treat expenditures on automation technology the same as it treats expenditures on labor, then automation technology would likely become less appealing to firms rather than more appealing, since that change would remove the relative tax benefit that firms currently receive from adopting the technology and since Acemoglu et al. suggest that the technology is not associated with remarkable productivity gains. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that automation leads to a decrease in productivity. Instead, the text states that Acemoglu et al. showed that productivity gains associated with automation technology \"are often unremarkable,\" meaning that the gains associated with the technology are not particularly noteworthy.</p>"

The text indicates that echinoderms have radially symmetrical body plans (symmetrical around a central point, usually in the form of a star), whereas most animals have bilaterally symmetrical body plans (symmetrical along an axis running from head to tail through a trunk). According to the text, sea stars are unusual echinoderms because, despite their radial body plan, they descended from known bilateral ancestors. This shift in body plan was thought to be a process of losing the genetic markers associated with the head region. The text explains that by comparing the genes of one sea star species (<em>P.</em> <em>miniata</em>) to those of a close relative, the acorn worm, researchers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes are active across the sea star&rsquo;s entire body, posterior (tail) genes are active in limited, peripheral locations of the body, and no trunk-related genes are active. This finding strongly suggests that, rather than becoming \"headless\" as they evolved from a bilateral ancestor, sea stars developed a body plan consisting almost entirely of a head region with a minimal tail region and no trunk region present.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t identify how any particular region of sea stars&rsquo; bodies influences the layout of sea stars&rsquo; radial symmetry. Moreover, the text indicates that the radial symmetry of echinoderms is \"usually starlike,\" not that a starlike layout distinguishes sea stars from other echinoderms. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the idea that sea stars evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry is incorrect (describing the bilateral origin as \"known\") and doesn&rsquo;t address any body plans other than those with radial or bilateral symmetry. The text strongly suggests that rather than revealing something about sea stars&rsquo; origin, Formery et al.&rsquo;s findings contradict the assumption that the current body plan of sea stars is \"headless.\" Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that Formery et al. were able to make determinations about <em>P. miniata</em> sea stars&rsquo; body plan based on the comparability of genetic markers between <em>P. miniata </em>and <em>S. kowalevskii </em>acorn worms. The text indicates only that little or no activity was observed in certain types of genes associated with body development in <em>P. miniata</em>, not that those genes turned out to largely differ from body-development genes in <em>S. kowalevskii</em>.</p>"

The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo&rsquo;s series <em>Reservation Dogs</em> focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a &ldquo;rejection&rdquo; of the typical approach to depicting Native characters.
